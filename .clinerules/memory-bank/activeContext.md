# Active Context: Coworking Space Trial Day Access App

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on transitioning the application from a kiosk-first approach to a user device flow. Recent development has centered on:

1. **User Device Flow Implementation**: Changing the application to work better on users' personal devices after scanning a QR code or visiting a link
2. **Email Access Emphasis**: Prioritizing the email with all-day access as the primary message
3. **Direct Door Unlock**: Maintaining the direct door unlock functionality through the Kisi API as a secondary option
4. **Real API Integration**: Configuring the application to use real API keys in local development
5. **Smoother User Experience**: Eliminating intermediate screens and delays for a more seamless flow

## Recent Changes

### User Flow Redesign
- Replaced the modal popup with a dedicated success page after email submission
- Created a new success.html page with a focused layout emphasizing email access
- Added success.js to handle the functionality on the success page
- Removed the countdown timer and auto-reset functionality meant for kiosk mode

### UI/UX Improvements
- Highlighted the email notification as the primary message on the success page
- Positioned the door unlock as a secondary option
- Added a "Need immediate access?" section for the door unlock option
- Enhanced styling with appropriate colors and visual hierarchy
- Removed intermediate messaging and delays for a smoother transition between pages

### Development Environment
- Updated the application to use real API keys in local development mode
- Removed the mock data implementation that was previously used for testing
- Configured Netlify Dev to properly load environment variables from the .env file

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### User Device Flow Considerations
Optimizing the application for user devices (rather than kiosk mode) required a different approach:
- Eliminating the need to return to the initial form after completion
- Focusing on a clear, linear flow with no looping back
- Prioritizing the email access message that works all day
- Maintaining the door unlock functionality as a secondary option
- Ensuring a smooth, delay-free experience between screens

### API Authentication
Working with third-party APIs requires proper authentication and error handling:
- Using `KISI-LOGIN` header format with API key for Kisi
- Handling 400/403/404 errors with specific user-friendly messages
- Providing detailed logging for troubleshooting

### User Experience Flow
The flow is designed to be simple and intuitive:
1. User enters email
2. System verifies eligibility and generates access
3. User is redirected to success page
4. Success page emphasizes the email with all-day access
5. User has option to unlock the door immediately if needed

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Integration Challenges
- Kisi API requires special attention to response format (using `secret` to construct URL)
- SendGrid custom fields must use string values instead of booleans
- Error handling needs to be robust for various API response scenarios

### UX Considerations
- Prioritizing the email access that works all day
- Providing immediate door unlock as a secondary option
- Clear visual hierarchy to guide users' attention
- Smooth transitions between pages without intermediate messages or delays
- Elimination of kiosk-specific features like auto-reset and countdown timers

### Performance Insights
- Direct API calls provide faster response than redirecting to third-party interfaces
- Detailed logging is important for production troubleshooting
- Environment-based behavior switching simplifies development
