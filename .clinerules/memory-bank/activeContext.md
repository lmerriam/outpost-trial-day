# Active Context: Coworking Space Trial Day Access App

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on ensuring the application is fully functional and user-friendly for kiosk usage. Recent development has centered on:

1. **Improving Direct Door Unlock**: Implementing direct door unlock functionality through the Kisi API to enhance user experience
2. **Error Handling Enhancements**: Adding detailed logging and user-friendly error messages
3. **Kiosk Mode Optimization**: Ensuring the application doesn't get stuck by eliminating external window redirects
4. **API Integration Stability**: Resolving issues with Kisi and SendGrid API integration

## Recent Changes

### Kisi API Integration
- Fixed issues with constructing the correct access URL from the Kisi API response
- Changed from using `expires_at` to `valid_until` in the Kisi group link request
- Added direct door unlock functionality via the `/locks/{id}/unlock` endpoint

### SendGrid Integration
- Updated custom field handling to use string values ('1') instead of booleans for compatibility
- Improved error handling when checking for previous trial usage
- Enhanced contact search logic to handle various response formats

### Frontend Improvements
- Modified the "Open Door" button behavior to call the door unlock endpoint
- Added fallback instructions instead of new window redirects for failed door unlocks
- Extended modal closing delay to give users time to read messages
- Improved loading and error state handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Kiosk Mode Security
Ensuring the application works well in kiosk mode requires careful consideration of how to handle edge cases and errors without getting the kiosk stuck. We've decided to:
- Avoid opening new windows/tabs for external services
- Automatically return to the main form after a set time period
- Provide clear, time-limited messages for both success and error cases

### API Authentication
Working with third-party APIs requires proper authentication and error handling:
- Using `KISI-LOGIN` header format with API key for Kisi
- Handling 400/403/404 errors with specific user-friendly messages
- Providing detailed logging for troubleshooting

### User Experience Flow
The flow is designed to be simple and intuitive:
1. User enters email
2. System verifies eligibility and generates access
3. User receives immediate door unlock option
4. User also receives email with all-day access
5. System automatically resets for the next user

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Integration Challenges
- Kisi API requires special attention to response format (using `secret` to construct URL)
- SendGrid custom fields must use string values instead of booleans
- Error handling needs to be robust for various API response scenarios

### UX Considerations
- Balance between immediate access and providing all-day options
- Clear feedback and error messages are crucial for user confidence
- Time-based auto-reset ensures kiosk doesn't remain in an unusable state

### Performance Insights
- Direct API calls provide faster response than redirecting to third-party interfaces
- Detailed logging is important for production troubleshooting
- Environment-based behavior switching simplifies development
