# Product Context: Coworking Space Trial Day Access App

## Problem Statement
Visitors interested in trying out the coworking space need a seamless way to access the facility for a trial day without requiring staff intervention. The current process requires staff to manually create temporary access passes and physically let visitors in, which is inefficient and limits trial availability to staff hours.

## User Needs
1. **Visitors** need:
   - A simple way to request trial access
   - Immediate entry to the space
   - Clear instructions for how to use their access
   - No technical barriers to entry

2. **Coworking Space Operators** need:
   - Automated tracking of trial users
   - Prevention of multiple trial uses per person
   - Minimal staff intervention for trial access
   - Integration with existing systems (Kisi and Optix)

## Solution Overview
The Trial Day Access App addresses these needs by providing:
- A simple kiosk-based interface for visitors to request access
- Automated verification of trial eligibility
- Direct door unlock capability via Kisi API
- Email delivery of access information for continued use throughout the day
- Tracking of trial usage in SendGrid

## User Experience Goals
