## Learnings & Evolution

The project has evolved from a simple access link generator to a complete solution with direct door unlock capabilities. Key learnings include:

1. **API Integration Complexity**: Working with third-party APIs required careful attention to documentation details, especially with authentication and response formats.

2. **UX Optimization**: The kiosk use case demanded special consideration for handling errors and preventing the system from getting stuck.

3. **Error Handling Importance**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages proved essential for a smooth experience.

4. **Testing Different Environments**: The environment detection feature simplified development while ensuring proper production behavior.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the production deployment on Netlify
2. Configure all environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Conduct real-world testing with actual visitors
