## Learnings & Evolution

The project has evolved from a kiosk-first approach to a user device flow with an emphasis on the email notification and consistent brand experience. Key learnings include:

1. **API Integration Complexity**: Working with third-party APIs required careful attention to documentation details, especially with authentication and response formats.

2. **UX Optimization**: Transitioning from kiosk to user device flow required rethinking the user journey and eliminating features designed for shared devices.

3. **Error Handling Importance**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages proved essential for a smooth experience.

4. **Flow Optimization**: Removing unnecessary steps and intermediate messages created a smoother, more seamless experience.

5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper emphasis on the primary action (checking email) vs secondary action (door unlock) improved the user experience.

6. **Consistent Branding**: Aligning the application's design language with the main Outpost website created a more cohesive and professional user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the production deployment on Netlify
2. Configure all environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Conduct real-world testing with actual visitors
5. Consider adding QR code generation for physical posting at the entrance
